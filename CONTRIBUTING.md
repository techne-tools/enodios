## Provenance (MurphySig)

This repository uses [MurphySig](https://murphysig.dev/spec) — a natural-language
provenance convention for human–AI collaborative work. As a condition of contribution:

- Do not invent signatures for files that lack them. If you modify a file with no
  signature, sign only your contribution and mark it `Prior: Unknown`.
- Do not invent authors, dates, or collaborator model versions you weren't part of.
- When modifying a file that carries a `Signed:` block, read the signature first,
  respect its stated confidence, and add a `Reviews:` entry documenting your change.
